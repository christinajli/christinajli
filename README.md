### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Christina, a software engineer focusing on building software systems and infrastructure in C++. I am also interested in AI/ML, computer vision, and image processing, and I hope to work on more projects in these areas. Some other technologies I am familiar with include compiler development with LLVM/MLIR, Python, Javascript, React, and TensorFlow.
